# RetHome
A repository to store code that has reached it's retirement age but that still has the capacity to make a contribution.
Code in this repository has not been keeping up with the latest developments in technology so might not function fully with the latest versions of julia.\
This code will not necessarily run without update as many scripts contain relative filepaths that do not correspond to the directory structure of this repository.\
The devisions in this repository are as follows:
1) Sch: a sub repository to store all the stuff I did relating to the Schlogl model
2) 3bath: a sub repository to store all the somewhat questionable 3 species gene switch model stuff
3)
